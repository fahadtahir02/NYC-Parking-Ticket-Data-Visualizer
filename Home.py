st.write('The motivation behind this project stems from us challenging ourselves to help NYC residents understand the frequency of violations in the most optimal way possible. Rather than reading a blog with paragraphs, why not allow users to understand the same amount of information by viewing a few graphs. We are creating data visualizations of NYC Parking Tickets data to analyze and draw conclusions. We want to see if there are any patterns we can identify in this data. The data we are using is around 30,000 rows of tickets that includes information such as Registration State, Violation Code, Violation Time, etc. Navigate to the Visualizations page to interact with the different models we made.
